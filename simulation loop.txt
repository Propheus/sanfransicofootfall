Agent Initialization
Each agent is instantiated with unique attributes influencing decision-making:
Hunger Level: Scaled from 0 to 1, increasing over time.
Patience Threshold: Determines how long an agent is willing to wait in a queue.
Income Bracket & Price Sensitivity: Dictates affordability and willingness to spend.
Brand Loyalty & Preferences: Affects restaurant selection based on prior experiences.
Decision Cycle (Per Timestep)
At each simulation step, agents dynamically adjust behavior based on internal states and environmental conditions:
Hunger Progression: Gradual increase in hunger level.
Patience Decay: Reduction in willingness to wait if already in a queue.
Decision Logic:
If not hungry → Continue random movement.
If hungry → Evaluate available restaurant options.
If in queue and waiting too long → Potentially leave.
Restaurant Selection Criteria
When deciding where to dine, agents assess multiple factors:
Proximity: Distance to the restaurant.
Wait Time: Current queue length and estimated service speed.
Affordability: Price vs personal budget constraints.
Past Experiences: Satisfaction history with the establishment.
Brand Influence: Reputation, marketing, and loyalty factors.
Dining & Transaction Process
Upon choosing a restaurant, agents follow a structured dining flow:
Queue Handling: If seating is unavailable, agents wait or reconsider.
Dining Phase: Once seated, agents consume food for a designated duration.
Payment & Exit: Agents pay based on the restaurant’s pricing tier.
Experience Logging: Agents update internal satisfaction metrics.
Memory & Behavioral Adaptation
Post-dining, agents refine future decision-making based on experiences:
Preference Adjustment: Updates in restaurant selection tendencies.
Visit History Tracking: Logs frequency and satisfaction scores.
Brand Loyalty Dynamics: Positive experiences reinforce repeat visits.
Simulation Execution
The system runs for 1,000 timesteps to observe long-term patterns.
At timestep 500, an economic shock occurs, impacting restaurant operations and modifying agent behaviors in response to market changes.
